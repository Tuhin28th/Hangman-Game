The *Hangman game* is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick-figure "hangman" is drawn, with the goal being to guess the word before the figure is fully completed. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position; if not, the hangman drawing progresses. Players win by guessing the word correctly and lose if the hangman is fully drawn. The game is popular for its simplicity and is often used for educational purposes, such as improving spelling and vocabulary skills. Digital versions, like the one you're developing, enhance the experience with dynamic word generation and interactive design.
